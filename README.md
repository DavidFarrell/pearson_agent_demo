```

## Usage

### Running the Skills Pathway Agent

To trigger the skills pathway agent, ask: "Hi, can you help me find an appropriate skills pathway?"

### Running Claude for Demos (Autonomous Mode)

For demonstration purposes, you can run Claude with autonomous permissions to avoid confirmation prompts:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This enables:
- Automatic file creation and editing
- Web browsing without confirmation
- Git operations without approval
- All tool usage without permission prompts

**⚠️ Warning**: Only use this flag in trusted demo environments where you're comfortable with autonomous operations.
